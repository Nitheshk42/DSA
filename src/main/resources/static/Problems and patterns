///Common LeetCode problems using HashSet
Problem                                  Why HashSet
Contains Duplicate                     Check if seen before
Happy Number                               Detect cycle
Intersection of Two Arrays              Unique common elements
Longest Consecutive Sequence             Fast existence check
Valid Sudoku                           No repetition allowed

Use HashSet when the question asks:

🔑 Pattern signals

Look for words like:
	•	contains duplicate
	•	unique elements
	•	seen before
	•	distinct
	•	remove duplicates
	•	intersection
	•	check existence fast
